Norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling , because showed that music piracy would not be accepted . A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100 , 000 kroner to the music industry , but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him , saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music . Bruvik's site was online between August and November 2001 , and while it did not host any music , at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers . However , the Supreme Court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law It added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act , and that Bruvik's actions were premeditated . A legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including Norway's performing rights society , Tono , and the Norwegian branches of Sony Music and Universal Music , who saw it as an important test of principle . Bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry .\n",

The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy . But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year .

      "SUMMARY: Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months . Howard Archer , economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\" . Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check . Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears . Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec Securities , said he believed rates would remain at 4 . 75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike . The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases . The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4 . 75% for a sixth month in a row . Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month , reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts . \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends . \"\n"

It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1 . 1% in the same period in 2003 . In London , the area with the highest average house price at £262 , 825 , annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7 . 1% from 7% the previous month .

But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market , annual house price inflation is still strong , up 13 . 8% in the year to November . The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats . The ODPM data showed the average house price was £192 , 713 in England ; £139 , 544 in Wales ; £116 , 542 in Scotland , and £111 , 314 in Northern Ireland .
